Welcome! I'm Michelle, a political science Ph.D candidate and applied statistics MS candidate at Northwestern. I study politics of race and inequity with a focus on the Afro-Latino diaspora, both in the United States and in Latin America and the Caribbean. My research centers on the topic of statistical invisibility for marginalized communities and identifying better ways to gather and measure quantitative data for racial minorities. I also engage in work dealing with the institutionalization of racial hierarchies and categories and how governments and elites set up racial denominations that don't necessarily represent the communities they enumerate.
